# Intro to python

Python is one of high level programming language, that means the syntax is similar to language that we use to communicate in our daily lives. Python was released in 1991, and most recent major version of Python is Python 3.

Python is often used in data science, because it is powerful to manipulate, process, clean and handle lots of data. As an intepreter, python and its standard library is available for public use and can be downloaded from its website.

Advantages of programming with Python :
- Open source
- Multi platform, can be installed in various operating system
- Python script is portable
- Various modules/libraries available to use
- Can be integrated with various database management system
- Can read and modify files
- Can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics
- Support socket programming
- Support GUI programming
- Support object oriented programming
- Relatively easy installation
- Have syntax and structure similar to the English language.

Preparation for learning python:
- Python is installed (we will be using Python 3 with this tutorial)
- `optional: `IDE that support python is installed

## Run your first Python code
For first try you can run file [`hello-world.py`](https://github.com/noviirna/learn-python/blob/master/0_intro/hello-world.py) using python command in your terminal, after you finished all of the preparation.  
  
You can see that the console will print "Hello World". Congrats you have run your first `.py` files.  
  
Now, lets try to run file [`terminal-input.py`](https://github.com/noviirna/learn-python/blob/master/0_intro/terminal-input.py). You will see prompt in the terminal that ask you to input something. Go try to input it, and see the output.

Besides using terminal, you can run your python code by :
- Using Python Interactive Mode
- Using IDE or Code Editor
- Run Python scripts with a specific Python Version on Anaconda
- Run a Python script using another Python script
- Using FileManager
- etc

## Python structure
### Indentation
Indentation in Python is very important, because it is used to indicate a block of code and defining scope for code in the line.

To try it, you can see example code in [`indentation-ok.py`](https://github.com/noviirna/learn-python/blob/master/0_intro/indentation-ok.py) and run it, the script will run because it has no error.  
Next, lets compare it with code in [`indentation-error.py`](https://github.com/noviirna/learn-python/blob/master/0_intro/indentation-error.py) and run it, it will print error in the console like this:
```
IndentationError: expected an indented block
```
#### Comment
There are 2 ways, to add comment in your Python code. there are 1 line comment and multi line comment, you can see example in [`comment.py`](https://github.com/noviirna/learn-python/blob/master/0_intro/comment.py) on how to add comment into your Python code.

After you try the practice files, next we will learn about data type in Python.
