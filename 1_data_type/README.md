# Data Type
In general, python have these data types:

   |Type|Description|Example|
   |----|----|----|
   |[`String`]()|Represent text.|'hello', '123', 'Hello123!*#', "hello", "123", 'Hello123!*#' |
   |[`Integer`]()|Represent integers.|-123, -1, 0, 1, 123|
   |[`Float`]()|Represent decimals.|-1.33, 0.07, 9.54|
   |[`Boolean`]()|Represent true / false.|True, False|
   |[`Complex`]()|Represent imaginary value.|1j, 2-6j|
   |[`List`]()|Represent collection of values that is ordered, and indexed. Elements in list can can have different data type and can have duplicate value. The list itself is mutable allowing elements to be removed and added.|[1, "1", 'Hello', False]|
   |[`Tuple`]()|Same as `List`, but immutable.|(1, "1", 'Hello', False)|
   |[`Set`]()|Represent collection of values that is unordered and unindexed. Set have immutable element, the element inside of it can have different data type and each element can't have duplicate values. The set itself is mutable allowing for elements to be removed and added.|{"hello","world"}|
   |[`Dictionary`]()|Represent collection of values that is ordered by key (key-value based), changeable, the value can have different data type and does not allow duplicates (for key name)|{"foo":"bar"}|
